# Smart-Food-Tracker
Smart Food Tracker is a simple web-based MVP inspired by my habit of forgetting food in the fridge until it expired. The project helps users track expiration dates and prioritize what should be used first. My goal is to raise awareness about zero waste living and show how small digital tools can support sustainable daily habits.
